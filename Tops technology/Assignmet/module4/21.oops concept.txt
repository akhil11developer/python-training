What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java


ans.
Object:
        object in instance of class 
        
        if class is datatype than object an instance  or variable of class 
        
        using object we can access all the property of class 
        
        one class can  have many object
        
Class:-
class is a collection of data member and member function
        or
        
        class which is contain data mamber amd member function in single enity
        or
        
        class is like group which is store different different data member in it
		
	or
	class is a user define datatype
 

inheritance :-
        inheritance is a powerfull concept in oops

        inheritance which is provide parent and child relationship
        
        one class derived properties of another class its called inheritance 
        
        using of inheritance we can reduce our code
        
        inhertitance provide reusability and reduce code , s0 , we can ave our time
        

Polymorphism
If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, 
for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.

we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

Another example can be to speak something; for example, a cat speaks meow, dog barks woof, etc.

Abstraction
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.


Encapsulation
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation. For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
